        <p itemtype="description" class="raleway">I created this font called “Crazy Joey”. The name is inspired by that uncle who
          is refined and sophisticated in the morning and turns crazy at night time. I wanted to create a fun and crazy font that
          you can use as a display font. The project evolution was; creating the alphabet, numbers, dingbats, a 3D printed letter
          and posters for advertising the font.</p>

        <p itemtype="description" class="raleway"> I researched and looked for inspiration which I could add to my font.</p>

        <p itemtype="description" class="raleway">Here are my sketches which shows my different ideas. At first I was going for
          a more refined font but then I focused more on making the font more refined in some aspects but crazy in other aspects
          thereby coming up with the name “Crazy Joey”.</p>
