    <p itemtype="description" class="raleway">I created a TV show and made a broadcast package. I feel like this is a strong piece
    because I created a TV show from scratch and then made a full broadcast package for it. I created a lower third,
    bumper and show intro. I went through the full process when creating this package. I created the creative direction,
    made stills and mood boards.</p>

    <p itemtype="description" class="raleway">When making this broadcast package I created a mood board that set the direction of the whole piece.</p>

    <img itemtype="image" class="moodboard" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/assets.jpg" alt="Assets for Worlds Apart.">
    <p iteamtype="description" class="raleway">I created assets that I would use in the final broadcast package with the same theme as the mood board.</p>

    <img itemtype="image" class="moodboard" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/style.jpg" alt="Style Board for Worlds Apart.">
    <p itemtype="description" class="raleway">I created these still scenes with the assets using the same style as the mood board and so that
    I would have an idea what the whole motion piece would look like.</p>
